# Account and Billing

St. Jude Cloud is built on top of [DNAnexus](https://www.dnanexus.com/), a data-analysis and management platform that specializes in the field of bioinformatics. All of our account management is shared between St. Jude Cloud and DNAnexus. In other words, if you have a DNAnexus account, you automatically have a St. Jude Cloud account, and vice versa. 

Each new user receives a $50 credit upon creation of their St. Jude Cloud account with DNAnexus (see the [note](#billing-setup) in the Billing Setup section).

!!! warning "St. Jude Employees"
    The account creation and login process is slightly different if you are an internal user (you work at St. Jude). Internal users please go to the [intranet home page](https://home.stjude.org) and type 'Bioinformatics Self-Service' into the search bar. From there, click on the link that says 'Bioinformatics Self-Service on St. Jude Cloud' to access the internal guide to creating an account.
