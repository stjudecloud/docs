### **Using the sample table**

The sample table shows overview of data from every patient and sample:

In above example, the NAME column shows patient name, and the samples
are identified for each patient. Some patients have only one sample
(diagnosis), while others have a pair (diagnosis/relapse). Following
each sample, the presence and abundance of various mutation data types
are indicated (SNV/indel, SV, CNV).

Notes:

-   The table only shows names of patients, rather than the name of specific sample.

-   ProteinPaint does not assume "diagnosis/relapse" are the only valid sample type. User is free to use any word to describe sample type.

Click on the "diagnosis/relapse" button representing sample types to
