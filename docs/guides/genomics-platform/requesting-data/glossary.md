### Data Access Unit

A St. Jude Cloud **Data Access Unit (DAU)** is a grouping of data that typically corresponds to a project, study, or dataset generated at the same time at the same institution. Each DAU has its own governing body of researchers, the [Data Access Committee](#data-access-committee), who preside over the data and who may grant or deny access. Each Data Access Committee has its own protocols for approving access to their DAU. Please [contact us](mailto:support@stjude.cloud) if you have questions about committee approval protocols. We currently have 5 DAUs: Pediatric Cancer Genome Project (PCGP), St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (SJLIFE), Genomes for Kids (G4K) and Clinical Genomics, Sickle Cell Genome Project (SGP), and Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). For a brief description of each DAU see the [Studies page](about-our-data.md#data-access-units). For a more detailed description please see the respective [Schedule 1(s)](../../../citing-stjude-cloud.md#dataset-reference-table).

### Data Access Agreement

A St. Jude Cloud **Data Access Agreement (DAA)** is a legally binding document outlining a number of terms and conditions to which anyone working with St. Jude Cloud data must agree.
We do not negotiate the terms of this document unless terms are found to be in conflict with the institution's state law. Filling out the Data Access Agreement carefully and completely is crucial to having your request approved promptly. [Click Here](../../../files/DAA_v4_10-1-2019.pdf) to download a copy of the DAA. [Click Here](how-to-fill-out-DAA.md) for a step by step guide on how to fill out the DAA.

If you have incompletely or incorrectly filled out your DAA and would like to upload a revised form, [Click Here](how-to-fill-out-DAA.md#uploading-a-revised-daa) for instructions.

Once you have submitted a correctly filled out DAA and have been granted access to one or more [Data Access Units (DAUs)](#data-access-unit), you can continue checking out files from those DAUs until your access expires. Access is generally granted for 1 year, at which point you must submit an Extension Addendum to continue using the data. [Click Here](../managing-data/how-to-fill-out-Extension.md) for a step-by-step guide on how to fill out the Extension Addendum.

### Data Access Committee

A St. Jude Cloud **Data Access Committee (DAC)** is group of St. Jude researchers who oversee access to a particular [Data Access Unit (DAU)](#data-access-unit) and evaluate incoming data requests.

The first time you request access to files in a DAU, it is required that you fill out a [Data Access Agreement (DAA)](#data-access-agreement). Access is granted at the DAU level based on the decision of each DAC upon reviewing the DAA.

!!! example
    For example, if you make a request asking for all of St. Jude's Acute 
    Lymphoblastic Leukemia sequencing data, you might be asking for data from 
    multiple different projects (DAUs) here at St. Jude. For the sake of the example,
    let's say the data you want is spread across three different DAUs. Once
    you place a request, your application will be routed to the corresponding
    three data access committees for approval. Since each DAC is made up of
    different individuals using different criteria for evaluation, you may or
    may not be approved for access to all of the files. 

### Embargo Date

The **Embargo Date** specifies the date that a publishing embargo on the file in question has been lifted. Publishing using any of the files _before_ the embargo date has passed is strictly prohibited as outlined in the [Data Access Agreement (DAA)](#data-access-agreement). Typically, samples from the same [Data Access Unit (DAU)](#data-access-unit) all have the same embargo date, as they would have been released on St. Jude Cloud at the same time.

**Current Embargo Dates**

| Data Access Unit                | Embargo Date                  |

| Clinical Genomics               | Rolling based on release date |
| Sickle Cell Genome Project      | September 1, 2019             |
| Childhood Cancer Survivor Study | November 1, 2019              |
