**Q. Will I be charged for using St. Jude Cloud?**

A. Although you may be prompted to enter billing information, you will not
be charged for anything with the exception of the following items:

* Any copy of the St. Jude data you receive is considered "sponsored",
  so you do not have to pay a fee to store this data in St. Jude
  Cloud. You will be charged for any *derivative* files obtained
  through running analyses on St. Jude data and stored on the St. Jude
  Cloud.
* If you elect to *download* any data from SJCloud, you will be
  charged an egress fee by DNAnexus. This fee is usually negligible
  unless you are downloading entire cohorts. We are actively
  investigating ways to minimize or eliminate these costs.
* If you run any of the following tools, you will be charged for the
  compute resources used in producing the results as well as storage
  fees associated with storing the results files.
    * [ChIP-Seq Peak Caller](guides/tools/chipseq.md)
    * [HLA Typing and Neoepitope Prediction](guides/tools/neoepitope.md)
